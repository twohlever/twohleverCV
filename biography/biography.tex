%	LETTER CONTENT
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Theresa earned her Bachelors of Science in Bioinformatics from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI).  She began her career at the Broad Institute working on the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) focusing on both de novo assembly of reference genomes and 16S analysis. In 2012 she transitioned to CLC bio, now QIAGEN, where she supports both publicly released CLC software as well as custom tools.




As the Broad Institute designated bioinformatician for the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) I identified the optimal sequencing technology for investigators to answer their biological questions in a cost effective way.  After their data was off the sequencers, I developed and provided automated reports the biologist team depended on. This required wrangling large quantities of diverse data types into clear figures for quick downstream decisions. In my my transition to the CLC bio support team I expanded my horizon from assembly analysis to every facet of secondary sequencing data analysis. I have successfully guided customers to overcome the challenges they face, often requiring transmission of large data sets for investigation. In addition to honing these problem solving skills, I have excelled in the art of clear communication across multiple teams with varied backgrounds. I know the difference in dialect between a biologist and a computer scientist. Perhaps, most importantly, I am adept at translating what I understand from these teams into palatable pieces for customers. In combination with overcoming scientific and technical challenges, it is in this interfacing and translational space that I find much satisfaction.
