%	LETTER CONTENT
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Blazing the trail from sample to insight is a treacherous journey. There are brambles, thickets, uneven terrain, partially accurate maps, and trodden trails leading to dead ends. It is the mission of QIAGEN Bioinformatics to clear the way for our customers to enjoy a pleasant stroll to their desired destination.

As the Broad Institute designated bioinformatician for the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) I was a torch bearer on this journey. I identified the optimal sequencing technology for investigators to answer their biological questions in a cost effective way.  After their data was off the sequencers, I developed and provided automated reports the biologist team depended on. This required wrangling large quantities of diverse data types into clear figures for quick downstream decisions. In my my transition to the CLC Bio support team I expanded my horizon from assembly analysis to every facet of secondary data analysis. I have successfully guided customers to overcome the challenges they face; this often requires data sharing for investigation. In addition to honing these problem solving skills, I have excelled in the art of clear communication across multiple teams with differing backgrounds. I know the difference in dialect between a biologist and a computer scientist. Perhaps, most importantly, I am adept at translating what I understand from those teams into sweet digestible pieces for customers. In combination with overcoming scientific and technical challenges that I know will make improvements in human health, it is in this translational space that I find much satisfaction. 

You do not see an advanced degree on my CV, however, I invested my years of undergraduate study at a top tier Institution. Immediately following I gained over four years of employment experience at the Broad Institute - a research intensive academic environment. There I regularly hashed out challenges with ALLPATHS and GATK developers. My experience in this community has allowed me to excel in my current role, which also requires an advanced degree. 

I am interested in the GISS Integrated Solutions Bioinformatics Scientist role to broaden my skill set and overcome new challenges. I would like a deeper relationship with the Ingenuity product development team as well as our clinical customers. I believe I would be a valuable asset to this team because of my ability to share insight regarding the sequencing data and performance in the upstream secondary analysis. Perhaps, most importantly, I will serve to further unify the CLC product and Ingenuity product development teams. I hope that this will aid in making the customer's journey from sample to insight a smooth and pleasant one.

Thank you very much for your consideration of my application; thank you especially for making this opportunity available to all members of the GISS team.
