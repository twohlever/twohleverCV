Dear \titleto \hspace{0.3 mm} \nameto,

I am a seasoned remote Bioinformatics IT Manager who will quickly prove to be an asset to Invitae’s mission. I have demonstrated success translating customer needs to clear software and analysis requirements for all U.S. based QIAGEN Digital Insight secondary analysis clients. I am well versed in the challenges associated with working from home every day brings. Today, I consistently leap over hurdles associated with managing remotely with acumen and grace.

I was early to flattening the covid19 curve when I became a fully remote employee in 2013. I left Boston, MA and continued my role at CLC bio, a QIAGEN company. My manager made it clear I was an essential asset to the team and ensured I was fully supported in this transition to continuously working from home.

Leadership asked If I would run my team through periods of my remote career with QIAGEN. I graciously accepted each instance with the understanding that a fully remote manager was not a permanent solution. I look back on those experiences with fondness. I enjoyed lifting up my [interim] reports to become their best selves resulting in high quality outcomes from California to Denmark to Romania. 

Through my management experience, I learned I enjoy the thrill of successfully negotiating interpersonal conflict more than the thrill of finding an unintentional assignment (=) instead of evaluation (==). The art of translating clinician needs into feasible software requirements brings me more joy than convincing my shell to use JRE 1.8 for GATK. I find bringing together diverse individuals to overcome the impossible through their complementary strengths more rewarding than my accomplishments as an individual. 

There are world class scientists who prefer disciplined deep work over leading a team. They often fear the challenges associated with navigating complex interpersonal relationships, but I embrace the challenge. Experience taught me excellence does not come through fear, but by ego-less pursuit of a clear vision. I’m not afraid of rooms where I am the least intelligent; I’m afraid of silencing voices with the most informed insight. I’m not afraid of shifting priorities; I’m afraid of failing to follow AGILE practices that enable effective response. I’m not afraid of hard choices; I’m afraid of paralyzing indecision. I’m not afraid of failure; I’m afraid of repeating the same mistakes and falling into complacent mediocrity.

Given my experience, demonstrated success, and passion for quality healthcare I will be a Bioinformatics Operations Manager who “consistently exceeds expectations” at Invitae.
