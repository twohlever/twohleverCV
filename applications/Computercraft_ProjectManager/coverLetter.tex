Dear \titleto \hspace{0.2 mm} \nameto,

\begin{flushleft}

I am writing to express my interest in the Project Manager position at Computercraft. With over a decade of experience in remote Bioinformatics project management and a proven track record of orchestrating cross-functional software development projects, I believe I possess the expertise necessary to excel in this role.

I recognize my education does not meet the "desired skills" of this role, though I believe my experience compensates for credentials. I embarked on my post-bachelor career at The Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard surrounded by the worldâ€™s leading scientists. I treasured the degree-free education I received through analyzing bleeding edge NGS sequencing technologies and proposing methods for improved analysis of 16S microbial communities. The weight of student loan debt drew me to a more lucrative position in industry.

As a seasoned remote Bioinformatics Manager, I have led diverse international teams in both clinical and non-clinical settings, ensuring the successful completion of complex projects. My ability to coordinate cross-functional teams of various sizes and skill sets has allowed me to deliver high-quality solutions on time and within budget. These solutions include customized bioinfomatic software for the FDA, FBI, and AFDIL.
	
I have a strong background in AGILE methodology primarily leveraged through Atlassian offerings (JIRA); I've presented its value to over 300 internal IT coworkers including multiple VP leaders. In my current role, I work so closely with DevSecOps I'm often mistaken to possess their administrative privileges. I've effectively implemented AGILE (Kanban) practices within my teams to drive efficiency and productivity. I have successfully guided teams, sized 2 to 25, through the full software development lifecycle (SDLC) in scientific environments. My expertise in quality control planning, milestone tracking, and resource coordination has consistently enabled me to over-deliver on project goals and exceed client expectations.
	
 Finally, I am well adapted to remote work environments. I have successfully managed and delivered projects while maintaining effective communication and collaboration remotely since 2013. I am confident that my ability to thrive in a remote work setting will enable me to excel in the current remote setup of this position.
	
 Thank you for considering my application. I hope to discuss how my background and passions align with making positive impact in Computercraft's success.

\end{flushleft}
