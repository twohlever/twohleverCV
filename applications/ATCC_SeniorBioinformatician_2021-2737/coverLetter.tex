Dear \titleto \hspace{0.3 mm} \nameto,


I joyfully began my career at the Broad Institute on the Human Microbiome Project weeks after graduating with my Bachelor’s degree in bioinformatics. I adored the culture. Everyone exuded excitement for discovery through their challenging pursuit of biological truth; every project promised meaningful impact. This was the mission that inspired me during my undergraduate challenges at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute; I was living my dream! Unfortunately, that dream ran into a wall of student loan debt. I was exhausted from working a second job, so I left the nonprofit sector for a  salary increase and for-profit pressure. With a significantly improved financial situation, I'm hopeful I can transition back to an organization that prioritizes public good over profit.

The skills I've acquired through my employment history make me an extraordinary fit for the Senior Bioinformatician role you've advertised. As an assembly analyst in the Human Microbiome Consortium, I was primarily responsible for \textit{de novo} assembling draft bacterial genomes. Due to Illumina's (then Solexa) read length constraints we depended on 454 for this work. I not only developed Perl libraries for my team to parse Newbler output, I also spearheaded automating routine quality checks for sample swaps, contamination, sequencer specific issues, etc. from LIMS exported data.
After nearly five years at The Broad, I moved on to the CLC bio Application Support team where I successfully guided customers in answering biological questions addressed with contemporary sequencing technologies (Next-Gen Sequencing). These included genomic resequencing analysis, transcriptomics, whole genome finishing, and \textit{de novo} sequencing.


I transitioned to the Custom Solutions team in 2016 where I was able to focus on both clinical and agricultural applications. Through these five years I've grown as a project manager such that I am now managing an intercontinental team of six while sustaining QIAGEN's relationship with multiple clients generating millions of USD in revenue. Most notably I've fostered a symbiotic relationship with the Vice President of bioinformatics for a company with more than 20 billion USD market capitalization. The many hurdles I've overcome in partnership with this client have led me to refocus my career. I value scientific discovery over profit; now that for-profit requirements have lessened in my personal life, I'd like my career path to reflect the nonprofit nature of my dream job.


I am interested in your Senior Bioinformatician role to pursue our joint mission of propelling life science research into the future and to broaden my experience with bioinformatic tools. I recognize my employment history may be more extensive than anticipated given this position's requirements; that is intentional. The high stress nature of my current role conflicts with my home-life priorities and the company culture I am seeking. I desire a position that continues to leverage my strengths, satisfies my passion for supporting therapeutic improvements through rigorous scientific discovery, yet allows me to participate in my children’s lives more fully. Thank you for your consideration.
