%% Supplemental information included in teh webform:
%% “"We adopted our three children out of foster care at the ages of 4, 6, and 6 years old. Their parents did not have the mental health required to consistently care for them. While our children now have a stable environment, their genetics place them at a great disadvantage. Through working with their pediatric psychiatrist, I know the struggle of finding the medication that best meets their needs. My parental experience inspired laser beam focus on my career goal to make meaningful impact in healthcare, especially within the pharmacogenomic space in pursuit of diagnostics and therapeutics for polygenic psychiatric disorders. I want to support this research relentlessly - making the impossible, possible. I want my children to be the last generation who suffers in this way and I want to leverage every skill and ability I possess to further that mission. The etymology of the word “passion” stems from physical suffering -- my passion for accelerating healthcare advancements stretches beyond warm fuzzies for helping others, it stems from suffering with my children. No passion is greater than a mother’s love for her children - this is the passion I will bring to DNAnexus clients."

Dear \titleto \hspace{0.2 mm} \nameto,

\begin{flushleft}
%I am a seasoned remote Bioinformatics Manager with demonstrated success leading cross-functional software development projects for both clinical and non-clinical applications. I have a track record of forging long term client relationships while demonstrating consistent delivery in a fast-paced, rapidly changing environment. Given my experience and desire to grow into a Director level role, I am confident I would make impactful contributions to the xVantage team leading to more "Aha" Customer Success moments.

%I recognize my education does not meet the expectations of this role, though I believe my experience compensates for credentials. I embarked on my post-bachelor career at The Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard surrounded by the world's leading scientists. I treasured the degree-free education I received through analyzing bleeding edge NGS sequencing technologies and proposing methods for improved analysis of 16S microbial communities. The weight of student loan debt drew me to a more lucrative position in industry and acceptance that pursuit of a PhD in computational biology was not in my foreseeable future for fiscal reasons.

%I transitioned to QIAGEN's Custom Solutions and Services team in 2016 where I focused on high value client relationships. Walking lock-step with end users on their customer journey I learned to accurately discern high profile low impact issues from higher impact but lower profile challenges. My success stemmed from an empathetic ear, effective prioritization, and commitment to iterative improvement. I sustained QIAGEN's relationship with multiple clients generating millions of USD in revenue. Notably, I fostered such a strong relationship with the Labcorp\rq{}s Vice President of \lq{}Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, and Bioinformatics\rq{} that I was actively recruited for my current role. 
 
%There are world class scientists who prefer individual deep work over relationship management. They may fear the challenges associated with navigating interpersonal complexities, but I embrace this challenge. Experience taught me excellence does not come through fear, but by ego-less pursuit of a clear vision. I\rq{}m not afraid of rooms where I am the least intelligent; I\rq{}m afraid of silencing voices with the most informed insight. I\rq{}m not afraid of shifting priorities; I\rq{}m afraid of failing to follow practices that enable effective response. I\rq{}m not afraid of hard choices; I\rq{}m afraid of paralyzing indecision. I\rq{}m not afraid of failure; I\rq{}m afraid of repeating the same mistakes and falling into complacent mediocrity.

%Given my experience and passion for high quality customer relationships, I have confidence I will become a key team player for xVantage at DNAnexus.
\end{flushleft}
