Dear Henrik and Lasse,

I am writing to you to let you know of my interest in the Software Test Engineer position, advertised on the QIAGEN careers website. Given the posted description, it seems my abilities and aspirations align extremely well; I believe I could provide great value in that role. I hope you do not mind that I am contacting you directly: application for positions within QIAGEN requires my direct supervisor's approval, so I wanted to reach out to you about this position in confidence initially.

My personal strengths, background in bioinformatics and extensive experience with the products of the QIAGEN Bioinformatics software line lend themselves perfectly to a Software Test Engineer role, both for our current products and for those we develop in the future.

I have, for many years, worked productively and efficiently with both the Support and Engineering teams in Aarhus. The timezone I reside in has often proved beneficial, giving several hours of overlap with the Danish office, followed by uninterrupted working time such that any information needed for further action can be delivered for the start of the next Danish working day.

If a potential transition into your team is something you, or others, wish to explore further with me, please do let me know. I'd be happy to address any questions you may have. While the Software Test Engineer role aligns very well with my skills, if there are other, perhaps as yet unadvertised, roles that you feel would better suit my abilities and interests, I would be very happy to hear from you about these.

I have not yet mentioned my interest in a career change to my teammates and direct supervisor, so I appreciate in advance your confidence in this matter.

Thank you for your consideration.

Cheers,

Theresa
