Dear Lasse,

As a U.S. based member of the support team since January 2012, I have been trained, and remotely trained others, on nearly every feature of the CLC product portfolio. More recently, I have branched out into supporting Ingenuity products; this has given me the opportunity to better understand whole workflows through QIAGEN Bioinformatics products. 

I am contacting you because I'm interested in redirecting my career towards development. When scanning through the QIAGEN career opportunities, I noticed a Software Test Engineer role, which appears to be something that I may excel in. As a member of the support team I have grown to recognize when the Workbench is functioning as intended, when it's not, and most importantly, when new features have introduced interesting side effects that don't appear to be inherently wrong on the surface, but would be appropriate to reconsider. I have communicated complex issues effectively and clearly such that it was possible for the development team to understand and resolve them. Finally, the time zone I reside in could be particularly beneficial for this role: I could test commits completed during the Danish work day such that feedback can be provided in time for the following Danish morning - perhaps this could lead to a more rapid turnaround going forward. If, however, there might be other positions you are aware of that I could be well suited for, I'd also be interested to consider those.

If my potential transition into development might be something you, or interested parties, may wish to explore further, please let me know. I'd be happy address any questions you may have.

I have not yet mentioned my interest in a career change to my teammates and direct supervisor, so I would appreciate your confidence in this request. 

Thank you for your consideration.

Cheers,

Theresa
