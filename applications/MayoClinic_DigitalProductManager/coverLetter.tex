Dear \titleto \hspace{0.2 mm} \nameto,

\begin{flushleft}
	I pored through stacks of disorganized paper records the night of April 6, 2022 to find the three month old girl placed in our care had the 22q11.21 duplication detected by Affymetrix CytoScanHD. The foster agency possessing access to her electronic medical records (EHR) did not know of her Likely Pathogenic mutation. The six weeks we were her primary caretakers made the long journey remaining for Healthcare IT clear to me. My experience caring for this medically complex infant drives my appreciation for Mayo Clinic's mission to inspire hope and promote health. I consider it an honor to play an active role in furthering this vision as Product Manager. With a decade of experience in remote Bioinformatics projects, a proven track record of orchestrating cross-functional software development, and a deeply personal desire to improve healthcare equity, I believe I possess the expertise and passion necessary to catalyze Mayo Clinic's mission.
	
	At QIAGEN I led diverse international teams in both clinical and non-clinical projects, shepherding the full Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) for custom bioinformatic software from conception to completion. I\rq{}ve enjoyed the privilege of mentoring junior colleagues located in the U.S., Denmark, India, and Romania. I\rq{}ve facilitated cross-functional teams of various sizes and skill sets delivering high-quality solutions. These solutions include customized software for Monsanto, Labcorp, and the FDA. Our team\rq{}s success stemmed from fostering an empathetic ear open to feedback, commitment to consistent iterative improvement, and clear stakeholder communication. As Product Owner, I sustained QIAGEN's relationship with multiple clients generating millions of USD in revenue. I developed such a strong relationship with the Labcorp\rq{}s Vice President  “Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, and Bioinformatics” that I was actively recruited for my current role. 
	 
	My current IT Manager role began with the ambiguous request to “make the team better.” The team consists of \(\sim \)7 bioinformaticians with a decade of entrenchment in their current roles and another \(\sim \)7 new hires. My vision for the team is to transition the culture away from siloed individual activities and embrace the significant benefits that stem from authentic collaboration. We\rq{}ve faced quite a few challenges but upfront trust building efforts are paving the way to ensure current development work is built on the foundation of psychological safety felt by every individual.  
	
	I\rq{}ve demonstrated success within the scope of typical data analysis, project manager, product owner,  scrum master, and manager roles throughout my career. Today, I\rq{}m seeking more aggressive learning opportunities in strategy development and longer term product roadmap planning. I look forward to authentically discussing how our values align and how my background and passions support driving value in your open Product Management role. Thank you for your thoughtful consideration.
	

\end{flushleft}
