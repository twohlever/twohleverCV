Dear \titleto \hspace{0.2 mm} \nameto,

\begin{flushleft}

	A week of persistent phone calls, emails, and a healthy dose of pleading finally resulted in transferring ~300 pages of my children’s medical history to our new pediatrician. We haven’t attempted the records from talk therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, or psychiatry. It’s not urgent; we’re on waiting lists. As an adoptive parent of former foster youth with trauma history, I am familiar with the challenges of coordinating healthcare. This is considered best in class. Within the scope of IT, contemporary healthcare is trapped in the class of 1984. Joining in “Two Minutes Hate” is tempting; instead I will direct my passion to lowering the hurdle for children like ours to access appropriate care. My primary post-graduate goal is to make dramatic improvement in healthcare IT as a Product Manager.

	While my formal education is in bioinformatic software development, my most fulfilling successes are connecting cross-functional teams to symbiotic solutions. Pursuit of productive collaboration by courageously and tactfully working through crucial conversations is my cultivated strength. My role in professional services taught me how easy it is to immediately commit “yes” to client requests. However, transparency and integrity prove higher value long-term benefits over positive yet fleeting social encounters. When scope, schedule, and budget are out of balance, all parties are dissatisfied. I aim to align these fronts within Healthcare IT by leveraging my strength as patient advocate, technical translator, and project manager with the skills I gain through the Katz Business school to become an impactful Product Manager.
