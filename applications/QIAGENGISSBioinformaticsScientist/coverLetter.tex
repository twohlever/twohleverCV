%	LETTER CONTENT
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Blazing the trail from sample to insight is a treacherous journey. There are brambles, thickets, uneven terrain, and frequent dead ends. It is the mission of QIAGEN Bioinformatics to clear the way for our customers to enjoy a pleasant stroll to their desired destination. The skills and experiences I have acquired through my employment history and education make me uniquely qualified to guide our clinician partners on the path from sample to insight.

As the Broad Institute designated bioinformatician for the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) I identified the optimal sequencing technology for investigators to answer their biological questions in a cost effective way.  After their data was off the sequencers, I developed and provided automated reports the biologist team depended on. This required wrangling large quantities of diverse data types into clear figures for quick downstream decisions. In my my transition to the CLC bio support team I expanded my horizon from assembly analysis to every facet of secondary sequencing data analysis. I have successfully guided customers to overcome the challenges they face, often requiring transmission of large data sets for investigation. In addition to honing these problem solving skills, I have excelled in the art of clear communication across multiple teams with varied backgrounds. I know the difference in dialect between a biologist and a computer scientist. Perhaps, most importantly, I am adept at translating what I understand from these teams into palatable pieces for customers. In combination with overcoming scientific and technical challenges, it is in this interfacing and translational space that I find much satisfaction. 

Although I do not have an advanced degree, I have four years of employment experience at the Broad Institute - a research intensive academic environment. There I contributed to 6 publications:  2 landing in \emph{Nature} and 1 in \emph{Science}. My experience in this community has allowed me to succeed in my current role which also requires an advanced degree. Before the Broad, I invested my years of undergraduate study at a globally ranked institution for science and engineering. There I laid a strong development and problem solving foundation through courses such as Data Mining and Database Systems.

I am interested in the GISS Integrated Solutions Senior Bioinformatics Engineer role to broaden my skill set and take on new challenges. I would like a deeper relationship with the Ingenuity product development team as well as our clinical customers. I believe I would be a valuable asset to this team because of my insight regarding the sequencing data and performance in upstream secondary analysis. I would like to serve to further unify the CLC and Ingenuity product development teams. I hope that this will aid in making the customer's journey from sample to insight a smooth and pleasant one.

Thank you very much for your consideration of my application; thank you especially for making this opportunity available to all members of the global GISS team.
