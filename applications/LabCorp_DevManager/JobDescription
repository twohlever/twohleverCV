FTE needed to coordinate all of the parallel projects that occur under the Bioinformatics umbrella. In addition to CEP funded projects, CBI participates in many other production enhancements, data analysis,
 algorithm development and research efforts. The increase of parallel streams demands full time oversight to alleviate pressure off of the Bioinformatics director. The role would coordinate the development assignments and schedules, oversee testing efforts and manage the release of enhancements. The Development Manager would work closely with the Production Support role and PMs to coordinate releases to Production. The role will maintain a CBI timeline of all ongoing and future scheduled efforts to provide transparency to leaders within IT and the business units.
