Dear \titleto \hspace{0.3 mm} \nameto,


I joyfully began my career at the Broad Institute weeks after graduating with my Bachelor’s degree in bioinformatics. I adored the culture. Everyone I encountered exuded excitement for discovery throughout their challenging pursuit of biological truth; every project promised meaningful impact. This was the mission that inspired me during the challenging times of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute; I was living my dream! Unfortunately, that dream ran into a wall of student loan debt. I was exhausted from needing to work two jobs, so I left the workplace my dreams were made of for a 30\% salary increase and for-profit pressure. With a significantly improved financial situation, I'm hopeful I can return to the workplace I continue to consider home.



The skills I've acquired through my employment history coupled with my service centric demeanor make me an extraordinary fit for the Product Support Specialist role you recently advertised. As a member of the CLC bio Application Support team, I successfully guided customers to overcome challenges that can be addressed with contemporary sequencing technologies. While honing these problem-solving skills, I learned to excel in the art of clear communication across multiple teams with varied backgrounds. I know the difference in dialect between bench biologists, clinicians, principal investigators, and computer scientists. Most importantly, I am adept at translating what I understand from these teams into palatable morsels for customers, and technical jargon for developers. Due to this strength, I've sustained QIAGEN's relationship with multiple clients generating millions of USD in revenue. A significant portion of that effort consists of aligning expectations regarding technical feasibility. For example, the Vice President of bioinformatics for a company with more than 20 billion USD market capitalization wanted 500GB BAM files be accessible in their S3 AWS bucket minutes after initiating upload. The harsh reality that this expectation could not be met was unsettling for a VP concerned with turn-around-time on their patients' test results. With back up from our enterprise team, I was able to reset the VP's expectations to something more realistic and continue to move forward with a positive relationship.

I am interested in your Product Support role to broaden my experience with bioinformatic tools alongside meaningful relationships with users and developers. I recognize my experience is likely more extensive that you would anticipate given this position's requirements; that is entirely intentional. The high stress nature of my current role conflicts with my home-life priorities and the company culture I'm seeking. I desire a position that continues to leverage my strengths, satisfies my passion for supporting therapeutic improvements through rigorous scientific discovery, yet allows me to participate in my children’s lives more fully.

Thank you for your consideration of my application; I hope to experience the joy of hearing from you.
